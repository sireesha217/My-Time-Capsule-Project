# My-Time-Capsule-Project Explanation:

The "My Time Capsule" project is a digital platform that allows users to store their personal memories, goals, or special messages and view them at a later date. The application is designed to let users reflect on their past experiences or aspirations by saving a title, writing a message, selecting a category, and setting a future unlock date. Once a memory is saved, it remains hidden until the specified date is reached, at which point it becomes viewable.

The interface contains two main sections â€“ one for adding a new memory and another for viewing stored memories. In the add memory section, users enter the details of their memory, choose its category from a dropdown, and set a future unlock date using a date picker. After saving, the memory is stored and organized for later access. In the view section, previously saved memories are displayed in a clean, card-style layout showing the title, description, category, and the date it was set to unlock.

The project encourages users to preserve valuable life moments in a meaningful way. With a visually appealing interface and simple interaction, it creates an emotional connection by allowing users to revisit their past thoughts or experiences. This digital time capsule serves as both a memory bank and a motivational tool for users.
